<h1 class="introduction">My pregnancy Journey</h1>
  

    <p>It was a planned pregnancy, although my husband was in far away Nigeria when i found out i was pregnant.<strong> Consequently, I navigated the initial stages of my pregnancy alone in the UK, extending into the first and a portion of the second trimester.</strong>open <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cu9R4p_MlAx/?img_index=6">maternity shoot </a> to see maternity shoot</p>

       <h2 id = "first-trimester">My first trimester; My diagnosis</h2>
       <p>During my initial trimester, I grappled with intense sickness, particularly severe morning sickness. Keeping food down became a formidable challenge, as I would vomit everything I ate, making both water and food seem like adversaries. The pain in my stomach was <em>excruciating</em>, and at times, I questioned my ability to endure it. Dehydration became a pressing concern. The situation escalated to the point where, on December 25, 2022 Christmas day, I was urgently rushed to the hospital as I nearly fainted. The diagnosis revealed <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/severe-vomiting/"><span id="symptom" >hyperemesis gravidarum</span></a>.<!--<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/severe-vomiting/">Read more on hyper remesis here.</a>--> I was given a note stating that I wasn’t fit to work. Two weeks after my initial discharge, I found myself readmitted for the same debilitating condition </p> 
       <p> <!--class="major-event"--><strong>I lost interest in <em>everthing</em></strong>!, My enthusiasm for everything waned – whether it was food, school, people, work or activities. Days were spent waking up to stare at the ceiling and the rug. I endured frequent bouts of vomiting, averaging at least six times a day. Standing for more than five minutes became a daunting task, confining me to bed where I would often find myself crying and engulfed in a somber mood. <strong>This being my first pregnancy</strong>, I had no prior knowledge of the challenges some people face. Despite having friends and family who had experienced pregnancy, I had never been close enough to comprehend their struggles.As I started feeling increasingly burdened, I ceased working and became cautious of my health and not losing the pregnancy</p>

        <h2 id="second-trimester">My second trimester</h2>
    
    <p>Contrary to the widespread belief that the second trimester is typically the most comfortable, <strong>I experienced morning sickness that persisted into this stage of pregnancy</strong>.</p> <p> <img src="images/5months%20pregnant.JPG" alt="5months pregnant"width="350" height="300" id="image">However, I had developed some coping mechanisms and could manage the sickness to some extent, partially due to my understanding of its pattern.Additionally, having my <em>husband</em> around provided crucial <em>support</em>. I was fortunate not to handle household chores and cooking alone, avoiding the nauseating food aromas.  Despite these adjustments, <strong>whenever I attended school lectures during this trimester, I would return home feeling unwell, often vomiting at least twice</strong>. Motion sickness compounded the issue, prompting me to carry an item for vomiting during bus rides to prevent any embarrassment or mess. It became evident that my morning sickness did not conclude with the first trimester. <span class="major-event">Nevertheless, I was able to participate in some enjoyable events during the summer when I felt relatively better. For instance, I visited the beach and attended a friend's birthday party in Bristol. This period marked a notable improvement in my overall well-being. as I became adept at managing the sickness, allowing me to improve my social life.</span> <a href="Summer%202023.html">click here to see summer pictures</a> </p>

<h2 id="third-trimester">Third trimester, PREMATURE MEMBERANE RUPTURE</h2>
    <p>At 34 weeks, <strong>my water unexpectedly broke</strong>, plunging me into a situation I never anticipated. From then on, I relied on incontinence  <em>pad</em> for the rest of my pregnancy. One evening, while cooking in the kitchen, I experienced a sudden rush of fluid. It was unmistakably different from urine, as I couldn't control the flow. Panicking, I rushed to the bathroom and called my husband. As we both witnessed the fluid pouring out and felt its stickiness, he promptly dialed the emergency line. The person on the other end stayed connected until the ambulance arrived to rush me to the hospital.</p>
        <p>Upon reaching the hospital, a series of checks were conducted to confirm the situation. The doctor examined my cervix to ensure the water had indeed broken, <strong>diagnosing a premature rupture of the membrane</strong>. They also monitored the baby's heartbeat, along with my blood pressure, temperature, and sugar levels. Satisfied with the results, the medical team reassured us that both the baby and I were in <em>good</em> health, and labor had not commenced. Despite our desire to have the baby delivered due to the ongoing uncertainties, <strong>the doctors advised that the baby was safer in the womb and could remain there until 37 weeks with close monitoring.</strong></p>
        <p class="major-event">I spent two nights in the hospital under observation, receiving antibiotics before being discharged. The plan was to attend check-ups twice a week, and if no contractions occurred by <em>37</em>weeks, induction would be considered. At 37 weeks, with no signs of labor contractions, I went in for <em>induction</em>. However, despite more than eight hours of efforts, dilation did not progress beyond 7cm. Consequently, an emergency Cesarean Section was performed, proving successful, and my baby boy, &lt;Ikechukwu&gt;, meaning "The Power of God" in Igbo, was born in less than 15 minutes after entering the operating theatre </p>
